Marinate chicken thighs with the following ingredients for ~10 minutes: 

- Light soy sauce (1 tbsp) 
- Dark soy sauce (1 tbsp or more) 
- Hua Tiao Jiu (1 cap, don't add too much) 
- Sesame oil (0.5 tbsp) 
- Sugar (1 tbsp) 
- Dash of pepper

Leave in the oven for 170 degrees for around 30-40 minutes - starting with the skin side down, then skin side up for the last ~20 minutes so that it becomes crispy!
