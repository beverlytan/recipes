This is a set of simple instructions if you want to thicken a sauce that might have already come pre-packaged (e.g. Tesco's garlic and wine mussels), and if you want to make it into a stew. 

- Add butter to a pan
- Fry onions and garlic 
- Add some flour to the pan
- When the flour starts to clump, add milk and chicken stock 
  - Add the milk and chicken stock slowly and bit by bit, until you reach your desired consistency
  - If you've added too much, just leave the sauce to boil to reduce 
- Add salt and pepper to season :-)
